# FIFO-LFU-Cache-Management
This project demonstrates the implementation of two cache management algorithms FIFO (First In First Out) and LFU (Least Frequently Used). These algorithms are used to manage cache memory effectively reducing access times by keeping frequently accessed pages in the cache.
