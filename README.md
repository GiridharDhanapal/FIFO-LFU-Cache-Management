# FIFO-LFU-Cache-Management

This project demonstrates the implementation of two cache management algorithms FIFO (First In First Out) and LFU (Least Frequently Used). These algorithms are used to manage cache memory effectively reducing access times by keeping frequently accessed pages in the cache.

## Project Features

FIFO Algorithm: Removes the oldest page in the cache when it reaches the limit.

LFU Algorithm: Removes the least frequently used page, with ties broken by the smallest page number.

## How to Use

Run the script to see the algorithms in action.

Input a series of page requests.

Choose the cache management algorithm (FIFO or LFU).

Observe cache hits and misses as the algorithm processes the requests.
